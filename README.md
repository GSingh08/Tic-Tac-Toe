# TIC TAC TOE

### ☛ Mission 💪:
 * #### Build Tic Tac Toe from scratch! ❌੦

Over the weekend, you will plan, pseudo code, and implement your first game!!!

This is a great stepping stone to creating your Unit One project and an excellent opportunity to plan and breakdown a problem first on paper, to understand its components before tackling the code.


### ☛ We encourage you to 🤓:
*  Play the game with the neighbor while thinking of the game logic.
* Whiteboard **ALL** the components your game will require!
* Pseudocode the complete logic to the last step

#### before writing a line of code!!!

### ☛ Things to think about 🤔:
- What is Tic Tac Toe? How is it played?
- What does it look like?
- How can you represent this programmatically?
- How can you use pseudocode to break down the functionality to the smallest piece?

Also, think about all the tools we've used so far:
- `strings`
- `numbers`
- `arrays`
- `objects`
- `functions`
- `booleans`
- `control flow structures`
- `DOM`

Which of these tools you are going to need to build this game?

### ❗️ Completion 👍...

- You have an `index.html`, a `main.js`, and a `style.css`. (Maybe also a `reset.css`? 🤔)
- Your tic-tac-toe is playable in the DOM
- Your tic-tac-toe can be won and lost
- Your game should be played by 2 people taking turns 👍
- You've uploaded your completed tic tac toe game to [BitBalloon](https://www.bitballoon.com/)

### ❗️ Submission 🙌...
An issue ticket on the [ada-students repo](https://git.generalassemb.ly/nyc-wdi-ada/ada-students/issues/new)that includes:
- A link to your fork of this repository with completed game
- A link to your Tic Tac Toe on BitBalloon.
- Completion, comfort, wins, losses, questions... you know the drill.
