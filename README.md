# TIC TAC TOE

Your mission is to build Tic Tac Toe from **scratch**!

Over the weekend, you will plan, pseudo code, and implement your first game!!! This is a great stepping stone to creating your Unit One project, so we encourage you 

### This is an excellent opportunity to plan and breakdown a problem first on paper, to understand its components before tackling the code.

Things to think about:
- What is Tic Tac Toe? How is it played?
- What does it look like?
- How can you represent this programmatically?
- How can you use pseudocode to break down the functionality to the smallest piece?

Remember, to logic through to the very end before typing a line of code! 

Also, think about all the tools we've used so far:
- `strings`
- `numbers`
- `arrays`
- `objects`
- `functions`
- `booleans`
- `control flow structures`
- `DOM`

Which of these tools you are going to need to build this game? 

## ‚ùóÔ∏è Completion looks like...

- You have an `index.html`, a `main.js`, and a `style.css`. (Maybe also a `reset.css`? ü§î)
- Your tic-tac-toe is playable in the DOM
- Your tic-tac-toe can be won and lost (**NOTE**: this does **NOT** mean you need to have any kind of AI logic so the player can play against the computer. In fact, _you should not do this_. This should be two-person tic tac toe.)
- You've uploaded your completed tic tac toe game to BitBalloon.

## ‚ùóÔ∏è Your submission should include...

- An issue ticket on the [ada-students repo](https://git.generalassemb.ly/nyc-wdi-ada/ada-students/issues/new)
- A link to your fork of this repository
- A link to your tic tac toe on BitBalloon.
- Completion, comfort, wins, losses, questions... you know the drill.
